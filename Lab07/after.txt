In this paper, we explore the feasi
bility of a medical training system
 for breast tumor palpation based o
n haptic augmented reality (AR) tec
hnology. Haptic AR is an emerging r
esearch area in haptics and virtual
 reality (VR), which is concerned w
ith augmenting the haptic propertie
s of a real object by means of virt
ual haptic feedback. The AR-based t
umor palpation system consists of a
 real breast sample.
